% There are five houses in a row: 0,1,2,3 and 4. 
% Each has a dfferent color (amber, beige, cyan, denim, emerald) and an owner of different nationality.
% The owners have differrent cars, pets and preffer different drinks.

% We know that:
% The Austrian lives in the amber house.
% Cider is drunk in the middle house.
% The Belgian owns the bulldog.
% The Czech lives in the first house on the left.
% The man who owns a Dacia lives next to the man with the eagle.
% The Czech lives next to the denim house.
% The Bugatti owner has a cat.
% The person in the beige house drives a Cadillac.
% Advocaat is drunk in the cyan house.
% The Dane drinks eiswein.
% The Estonian drives an Edonis.
% The Cadillac is always parked in front of the house next to the one with a donkey.
% The cyan house is immediately to the right of the emerald house.
% The Aston Martin owner drinks daiquiri.
